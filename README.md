KryptoKraken, brings a simple crypto news platform for all your trading needs! Browse the top cryptos, trading platforms and see realtime news and crypto updates!

## Inspiration
Being deeply, invested into crypto currencies, I often saw a lot of overcomplicated web sites with too much information for beginners (such as me a while back)
to handle. KryptoKraken, brings a streamlined and simple user interface with the basics information that everyone wants, and will often come looking back for.

I also wanted to implement, RapidAPI for this project, and I did so through using Coinranking API and Bing News Search API. Furthermore, I wanted to practice
my Redux skills, and practice implementing more complex REST API endpoints.

## How KryptoKraken Works

The website is made with React,Redux,AntDesign and GraphQL. The API's I used were generated through RapidAPI and I used redux toolkit to create the endpoints,
and reusable React components to display & filter such data through the users discretion.

## How to run Capsule

Setup:
- cd to project folder
- Install Node_Modules through ```npm install```
- Run the website ```npm start```
- Enjoy!
